# verboseLog

**Is Your Debugging Process Holding Back Your Webflow Enterprise Projects?**

Managing large codebases can be daunting, especially when youâ€™re stuck using basic console logs. 
Without advanced logging tools, critical details can slip through the cracks, leading to inefficient debugging and cluttered code.

**verboseLog** is built to solve this.

**Verbose Log** is a lightweight, yet powerful, JavaScript utility tailored for enhanced logging in Webflow projects. 
It offers environment-based log levels (ðŸ”´ critical, ðŸŸ  error, ðŸŸ¡ warn, ðŸŸ¢ debug, ðŸ”µ info), custom staging domain support, 
and flexible toggling options. While optimized for Webflow, itâ€™s versatile enough to be integrated into any web project.

## Features

- **Environment-Based Logging**: Automatically adjust log verbosity based on whether the current domain is staging or production.
- **Custom Staging Domains**: Easily define which domains should be treated as staging environments.
- **Logging Levels**: Support for `ðŸ”´ critical`, `ðŸŸ  error`, `ðŸŸ¡ warn`, `ðŸŸ¢ debug`, and `ðŸ”µ info` levels.
- **Toggle Logging**: Enable or disable logging globally, giving you full control.

## Installation

### For Webflow Projects

To integrate `verboseLog` in a Webflow project: 
- Go to the Webflow project's **Settings > Custom code > Head code**
- Copy the code block bellow and paste it in the **Head code** 

```html
<!-- Verbose Log by JP Dionisio -->
<script async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jpthedio/verbose-log@main/verbose-log.min.js"></script>
```

#### Important Note for Async or Defer Loading

If you choose to load the script asynchronously `async` or defer its execution `defer`:
- ensure that all verboseLog calls are wrapped inside a DOMContentLoaded event listener.

This guarantees that the script is fully loaded and ready to use before any logging takes place.

```html
<!-- Verbose Log by JP Dionisio -->
<script async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jpthedio/verbose-log@main/verbose-log.js"></script>

<!-- Custom code by you -->
<script>
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
// Your verboseLog calls here
verboseLog('This is a log message with async script loading.', 'info');
});
</script>
```

## Usage in custom code

### Basic Setup

To use verboseLog, simply include the script in your Webflow Site Settings Head code or HTML file. 
The function will be available globally.

### Log Levels

| Level       | Description                                                         | Visibility                 | Default Emoji  |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|
| `critical`  | Used for critical issues that need immediate attention.             | Staging and production.    | ðŸ”´ (Red circle) |
| `error`     | Indicates errors that have occurred but do not stop the website.    | Staging and production.    | ðŸŸ  (Orange circle) |
| `warn`      | Warnings about potential issues that should be monitored.           | Staging only.              | ðŸŸ¡ (Yellow circle) |
| `debug`     | Detailed debugging information for development and troubleshooting. | Staging only.              | ðŸŸ¢ (Green circle) |
| `info`      | General information about website state or operations.              | Staging only.              | ðŸ”µ (Blue circle) |

### Example Usage

```html
<script>
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
// Set custom staging domains globally
verboseLog.stagingDomains = ['staging.yourdomain.com', 'preview.yourdomain.com'];

// Turn off logging
verboseLog.isEnabled = false;
verboseLog('This message will not appear.', 'info'); 
// No output, logging is disabled

// Turn on logging
verboseLog.isEnabled = true;
verboseLog('This message will appear.', 'info'); 
// ðŸ”µ [INFO]: This message will appear.

// Log messages with different levels
verboseLog('A critical error occurred!', 'critical'); 
// ðŸ”´ [CRITICAL]: A critical error occurred!

verboseLog('An error was encountered while processing your request.', 'error'); 
// ðŸŸ  [ERROR]: An error was encountered while processing your request.

verboseLog('This action is deprecated.', 'warn'); 
// ðŸŸ¡ [WARN]: This action is deprecated.

verboseLog('Application initialized successfully.', 'info', 'âœ…'); 
// âœ… [INFO]: Application initialized successfully.

verboseLog('Debugging data: user ID = 12345.', 'debug'); 
// ðŸŸ¢ [DEBUG]: Debugging data: user ID = 12345.

// Usage with only the first parameter given
verboseLog('This is a simple message'); 
// ðŸ”µ [INFO]: This is a simple message
});
</script>
```

### Configuration

- Custom Staging Domains: Add domains to verboseLog.stagingDomains to treat them as staging environments.
  - Default staging domain is 'webflow.io'
- Enable/Disable Logging: Use verboseLog.isEnabled to toggle logging on or off.
  - Logging is enabled true by default.

```html
<!-- Verbose Log by JP Dionisio -->
<script async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jpthedio/verbose-log@main/verbose-log.js"></script>
<!-- Verbose Log custom options -->
<script>
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
    // Example: Adding a custom domain and enabling logging
    verboseLog.stagingDomains.push('beta.yourdomain.com');
    verboseLog.isEnabled = true;
});
</script>
```
